# NightCrawler v1.6

## NightCrawler Web Scraper

NightCrawler is a tool developed in Python that we can use as a foot-printing tool against our own web pages.

NightCrawler is Object-Oriented (a Class), so you can reuse the code for make a better (more interesting?) program. 
The code at this point only follows links to web pages, not to binary files, but you can reuse the data that the "crawler" object generates.

root = "http://www.google.com/"

Now just run the script: nightcrawler.py
